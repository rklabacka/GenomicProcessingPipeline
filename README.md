# GenomicProcessingPipeline

Pipeline for processing "raw" genomic data (whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and target-capture sequencing)
_This code was used for data processing and analyses in Klabacka et al. (in prep)_

## Project Backround

Studying factors driving natural variation in life-history strategies can help us understand how senescence evolves. Divergent ecotypes (slow-aging and fast-aging) of western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans) provide a useful model system for examination of these factors. Here we examine gene expression and population genetics within and between these divergent ecotypes, and find support for hypothesized life-history divergence at the molecular level. We store our code for data processing and analyses, along with documentation for reproduction, within this repository.
